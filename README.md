# Portable Glue Gun

In this porject we designed a portable by incorporating all the necessary features depending on the needs of the market and our budget. Preliminary product specification and House of Quality was developed depending on the needs of the consumers using data acquired from a customer survey which was sent out to an anonimous audience. On analyzing the data acquired by the survey, a functional block was developed highlighting all the functions that can be incorporated in the product. All the functions were ranked based on their importance. The highly ranked functions were incorporated in the product. Product specifications were defined based on quality and budget.

A detailed cost analysis was performed to help make make/buy decisions. In the detailed design phase, CAD drawings of all parts of the product were designed and assembled.
